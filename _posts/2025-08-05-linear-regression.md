## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
Linear regression the process of finding a line in a graph that best fits the data. Due to it's basicness (I don't know if this is even a word - it is), linear regression is one of the first things that people learn when starting their machine learning journey.

## ðŸ“ˆ The Big Idea

Just as I mentioned above, you only have to think of linear regression as fitting the best line to the data! You would probably know that the equation of a line is:<br>
$`y = wx + b`$<br>
So to fit the line, you would have to change the $`w`$ and $`b`$ values.

## ðŸ“Š What does It Actually Do?
By fitting a line which is close to all data, we would be able to predict new values based on it.
