### ðŸ“Œ Introduction
We've learned that linear regression was fitting the best line through data. Logistic regression is fitting the best S-shaped curve. Logistic regression is also a type of `supervised learning` (has labeled data), and while linear regression is a regression model which predicts continous values for its output, logistic regression is a classification model (although it's called logistic 'regression'), which can only have two possible outputs: 0 and 1. Logistic regression is used to find out yes or no questions. Such as spam detection (is this a spam or not?), medical diagnosis (does this person have a disease or not?), and fraud detection (is this a fraudulent transactioin or not?).
