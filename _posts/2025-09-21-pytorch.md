## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
In this blog post, I will walk you through the basics of Pytorch, an open-source deep learning frame work which is used to build AI products such as [Tesla Autopilot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBklltKXtDE), [GPT-3](https://openai.com/index/gpt-3-apps/), and [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/stable-image). It's very popular because:
- It's easy to understand like Python
- Has a strong open-source community
- Mainly used in research

Before we start, this is how to import PyTorch:
```python
import torch
```

## ðŸ”¢ Tensors
I think that it's pretty reasonable to think pytorch as:<br>
***PyTorch = Python + Tensors + Autograd***<br>
The first thing I will talk about are tensors.<br>
Tensors are the heart of PyTorch; but it's actually just an arrary that has several useful features.<br>
This is how you initialize a tensor:
```python
# create tensor
x = torch.tensor([3.14, 1.59])
print(x)
```
